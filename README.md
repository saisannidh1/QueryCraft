QueryCraft is a smart SQL assistant that allows users to have a natural language conversation with their databases. Upload your own SQLite database or use the built-in Chinook music sample to get started. This project leverages Google's Gemini Pro to translate English questions into SQL queries, executes them, and displays the results in a user-friendly chat interface.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language to SQL:** Translates plain English questions into complex, executable SQL queries.
- **Dynamic Database Support:** Users can choose to interact with the built-in sample database or upload their own SQLite file for instant analysis.
- **Conversational Memory:** Remembers the context of the conversation to answer follow-up questions accurately.
- **Interactive UI:** A clean, chat-based interface built with Streamlit for a modern user experience.
- **Robust Query Generation:** The AI is prompted to handle complex schemas, including edge cases like spaces in table names.

## Tech Stack

- **AI Engine:** Google Gemini Pro (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest`)
- **Backend:** Python
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Deployment:** Docker, Streamlit Community Cloud
